<h2 class="nobreak">FOREWORD</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> the last twenty years the housewives
of our country have been more and more depending
upon the bakers for the bread used
in the homes. In some of our cities the home-baked
loaf is hardly known.</p>

<p>Although the commercial bread has been
of great variety and of excellent quality, it
has never been an economical method of
serving the family with the staff of life.</p>

<p>By depending upon ready-baked bread we
have come to consider it a difficult process to
make good yeast bread and almost a hardship
to try to have home-made bread.</p>

<p>I had fallen into the habit of buying my
bread; my family was so small that it hardly
seemed necessary to insist that bread should
be made in my kitchen when good bread
could be bought at a reasonable price. The
result was that when the call came to conserve
the wheat, I resorted almost entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
to quick breads made with baking powder or
with sour milk and soda. However, the experiments
that I made with these materials
proved so interesting and satisfactory that
I decided to see what I could do with a yeast cake
and other grains than wheat.</p>

<p>My first experiments were failures and I
was discouraged because, instead of saving
food, I was wasting it, and yet I was unwilling
to acknowledge myself defeated by the
little square of leaven that came to me so
attractively done up in tinfoil.</p>

<p>After careful consideration I decided that
I had rushed into undue intimacy with a force
of which I had very little understanding and
that I might do better if I cultivated the acquaintance
by degrees.</p>

<p>My next experiments were made with a
very simple sponge of whole wheat flour,
water, and yeast, which I allowed to rise for
about four hours. I divided it into four parts,
and to one I added scalded corn meal and
rye flour; to the second, raw corn meal and
whole wheat flour; to the third, barley flour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
and rye; and to the fourth, rice flour. I put
salt in each lot, but no sugar or shortening.
As I worked I kept a paper and pencil beside
me and made careful notes of everything I
did, also of results that I expected and of any
doubts that occurred to me as to the wisdom
of what I was doing. The four little loaves
that resulted taught me many things and
were the beginning of experiments that
lasted through the summer&mdash;experiments
that any housekeeper could make, for I had
no laboratory, only the kitchen of my country
house and the utensils found in every
house.</p>

<p>In giving the results of my summer&#8217;s work I
have tried to make the recipes so simple and
yet explicit that the most inexperienced cook
can follow them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">YEASTS</h2></div>


<h3><i>Buttermilk Dry Yeast</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Put</span> one quart of buttermilk in a double
boiler, and when it is scalding hot add one
and one half quarts of corn meal and one
teaspoonful of salt, and stir well. Let this
mush cool, and then add one yeast cake that
has been dissolved in one half cup of lukewarm
water. Set the mixture in a warm
place, and when it rises stir it down and let
it rise again. Repeat this process three times,
and then add more corn meal and enough
whole wheat flour to bind it so that it can
be made into cakes. Use a rounding tablespoonful
to each cake if they are to be used
in winter, less if for summer use. Let them
dry as quickly as possible, but do not put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
them in the oven or in the sun. A rack hung
high over the stove is a good place to dry
them. They should have a sour, but not disagreeable,
smell. These will keep all summer
on a dry pantry shelf.</p>


<h3><i>Potato and Hop Dry Yeast</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Boil</span> together four small potatoes and one
half cup, packed, of dry hops, using three
pints of water. When the potatoes are done,
take them out and put through a sieve or
ricer. Add two cups of whole wheat flour and
mix well. Strain the boiling hop water over
this mixture and beat till it is a smooth batter.
Add one tablespoonful of salt and the
same of ginger and one half cup of sugar.
When lukewarm, add one yeast cake that
has been dissolved in one cup of lukewarm
water. Let this stand one or two days, the
time depending upon the temperature of
the room, stirring it down occasionally.
When it smells good and sour, add corn meal
till it is thick enough to handle. Make into
cakes, using a rounded tablespoonful if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
are to be used in winter and less for summer
use. Dry quickly, but do not put in the oven
or in the sun. It will take a few days before
they are dry enough to put away. These
will keep in a box on a dry pantry shelf winter
or summer.</p>

<p>One cake is equal to a cake of compressed
yeast.</p>


<h3><i>Continental Dry Yeast</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> putting the bread in pans save out
a pint of the dough. Roll this half an inch
thick, put it on plates, and leave it on the
pantry shelf, turning it occasionally. It will
become quite sour as it dries. After a few
days the drying may be hastened, but do
not overheat it or the yeast plant will be
killed. When dry, break it into convenient
pieces and put in a box or jar. To use, break
into small pieces, enough to half fill a cup
and soak till soft in lukewarm water. Use
like any yeast. I have had satisfactory results
using this yeast for raising a sponge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>Liquid Yeast</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> will keep one or two weeks in summer
and five or six in winter if not allowed to
freeze. Scalding or freezing kills the yeast
plant.</p>

<p>Add one cup of dry hops to two quarts of
boiling water and boil gently for fifteen minutes.
In the meantime peel and grate five
large potatoes into enough water to cover
them; this is to prevent them from turning
dark. Add one cup of sugar, one tablespoonful
of salt, and the same of ginger. Put this
mixture into a saucepan and pour over it
the water in which the hops have boiled.
Cook, stirring all the time till it thickens,
turn into a perfectly clean crock or jar, and
when lukewarm add two cups of good yeast
or two yeast cakes that have been dissolved
in two cups of lukewarm water. Keep the
jar where it is moderately warm and stir
the yeast down as often as it rises. When
fermentation stops, it will be quite thin. It
should then be covered closely and put in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
cool place. It is good as long as it smells
sour but does not taste so. When yeast loses
its smell it has no more rising power; in
other words, the yeast plant is dead.</p>

<p>One half cup of this yeast is equal to one
cake of compressed yeast.</p>

<p>The potatoes may be boiled and mashed
through a sieve, but practical bread-makers
say that the grated potatoes make the best
yeast.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SUGGESTIONS<br />
FOR THE MAKING OF BREAD<br />
WITHOUT WHITE FLOUR</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Breads</span> made with little or no wheat to be
successful must be treated in a different way
from white flour breads. If there is cooked
cereal in the dough it must be made much
stiffer than for ordinary bread. All dark
breads must be well risen in the dough, but
must not rise to double their bulk after putting
in the pans; only to half double. The
oven should not be as hot as for white bread;
it should be at a temperature so that a small
loaf will not be overdone in an hour and a
quarter.</p>

<p>When possible use milk, or at least part
milk, for the liquid in making the sponge; the
dough will use less flour and require less
kneading and the bread will have greater
food value. The milk must be scalded and
cooled or it may sour as the dough rises. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
corn meal is to be scalded with the milk, it is
better to stir the meal into the milk when
it is in the saucepan on the stove rather than
to pour the hot milk over the meal.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t make the mistake of having the
dark loaf sweet. One tires very soon of a
sweet bread as the staff of life.</p>

<p>In using recipes for these new breads it
is necessary to remember that at the present
time there is no standard for these meals
and flours that we are using. There are
many good kinds on the market that differ
in the amount of liquid that they will take up.</p>

<p>In none of the recipes calling for whole
wheat flour do I refer to flour with bran in
it. Whole wheat, rye, oat, barley, and rice
flour should be fine enough to go through a
fine flour sieve; otherwise they should be
called meals.</p>

<p>Corn flour and the very fine bolted meal
are as fine as the whole wheat flour and cannot
be used for the recipes calling for corn
meal. The coarser bolted meal can be
treated as the fine granulated meal.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>In making yeast bread always have the
liquid lukewarm, and in cold weather it facilitates
matters to warm the flour.</p>

<p>Never let sponge or dough get chilled
until it has risen once; after that it can be
put in the ice box to check fermentation till
it is needed to make into rolls or coffee
bread.</p>

<p>Thick stoneware is the best material for
a mixing-bowl for yeast bread, but it is heavy
to handle. If the sponge or dough is set to
rise in a tin dish it should be well wrapped
in a thick cloth to keep the dough at an
even temperature. Both sponge and dough
will stand a good deal of hard treatment, but
the bread-making will be slow and the result
poor.</p>

<p>A bread-mixer is a great labor-saver, but
there should be a thick cloth cover to be used
with it.</p>

<p>The rising of dough may be hastened by
setting the dish in a pan of warm water and
adding more from time to time to keep up
the temperature.</p>

<hr class="chap" />





<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">SPONGES</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">All</span> foreign bakers use the sponge method
for their best breads and rolls and refer to
that made from the straight dough as &#8220;off-hand
bread.&#8221;</p>

<p>They reasonably claim that it has many
advantages; that the bread made from a
sponge has a better flavor, requires less
shortening and less yeast, keeps moist longer,
and is more velvety in texture.</p>

<p>It is a more convenient method, for although
the sponge will rise in four hours it
can stand longer than the straight dough
without deterioration, and many kinds of
bread, coffee cake, and rolls can be made from
one sponge.</p>

<p>All dark breads have a more attractive color
if one tablespoonful of dark molasses is added
to the sponge, but this hastens the rising; so,
if the sponge is to stand overnight, do not
add it till morning when the bread is mixed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>Salt retards the rising, so it is better in cold
weather to add that when the bread is made
up.</p>


<h3><i>Whole Wheat Sponge</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Scald</span> three cups of milk and let it stand till
it is lukewarm. Add one teaspoonful of salt
and one tablespoonful of molasses and one
yeast cake that has been dissolved in one
half cup of warm water. Stir in enough whole
wheat flour to make a drop batter. Beat well
and put it in a covered dish to rise. Use as
directed in the bread recipes. Water can be
used in place of milk.</p>


<h3><i>Potato Sponge</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mash</span> or put through a ricer enough hot
boiled potatoes to make two cupfuls. Add
two cups of whole wheat flour and mix well.
Pour over this two cups of the water in which
the potatoes were boiled; this should be hot
enough to thoroughly scald the mixture. Add
one tablespoonful of molasses and two teaspoonfuls
of salt. Stir till it is a smooth
batter. If this is to be made into a sponge at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
once, add one cup of cold water, and when
the batter is lukewarm add one yeast cake
that has been dissolved in one cup of lukewarm
water. Set it to rise four hours.</p>

<p>The potato and flour mixture may be made
and scalded at any time that it is convenient
to cook the potatoes and can stand until it is
wanted for the sponge. If it has become cold,
add one cup of water hot enough to make the
mixture lukewarm and proceed as directed
with the yeast.</p>


<h3><i>Corn Meal Sponge</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Boil</span> four medium-sized potatoes in one
quart of water. When done pour three cups
of the boiling potato water over one and one
half cups of corn meal and stir till it is smooth.
Add one and one half cups of the potato that
has been mashed or put through a ricer, one
tablespoonful of salt, and one of molasses.
When this is lukewarm, add one yeast cake
that has been dissolved in one cup of lukewarm
water. Set it to rise and use as directed
in the recipes for sponge bread.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>Oat Flour Sponge</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Take</span> one and one half cups of hot mashed
potato, two cups of sifted oat flour, mix well,
and scald with two cups of the boiling water
in which the potatoes were cooked. Add one
tablespoonful of molasses and one of salt.
When cool, add one yeast cake that has been
dissolved in one cup of lukewarm water.</p>


<h3><i>Oatmeal Sponge</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Pour</span> two cups of boiling water over two cups
of rolled oats and let it stand covered for two
hours. Add two cups of whole wheat flour
and one cup of water hot enough to make the
mixture lukewarm. Stir well and add one
tablespoonful of salt and the same of molasses.
Add one yeast cake dissolved in one
cup of lukewarm water and set to rise.</p>


<h3><i>Four Varieties of Bread from one Potato
Sponge</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the potato sponge is light and foamy,
put one third of it aside. To the other two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
thirds add enough whole wheat flour to make
a soft dough, but one that can be handled.
Knead till it is smooth and velvety. Set it to
rise. When it has doubled its bulk knead
a little and divide it in two. Make a loaf
of one part, and when it has half doubled
its bulk bake in a moderate oven for an
hour.</p>

<p>Roll the remaining dough into a strip half
an inch thick. Spread with brown or white
sugar, using a half cupful. Sprinkle one teaspoonful
of cinnamon over the sugar and lay
on a few raisins. Roll up carefully and put
into a bread pan to rise till it has half doubled
its bulk. Bake in a moderate oven. If the
sheet of dough is kept as wide as the bread
pan is long, this will fit in and when it is cut
the spiral of sugar and cinnamon will show
to perfection.</p>

<p>To the remaining sponge add rye flour till
it is stiff enough to handle, rather a stiff
dough. Set it to rise, and when doubled its
bulk make all but one and one half cups of
the dough into a small loaf and let it rise till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
it has half doubled its bulk. Bake an hour
in a moderate oven.</p>

<p>To make coffee cake from the remaining
dough, first cream together one tablespoonful
of shortening with two tablespoonfuls of
sugar. Cut this into the dough with a knife
and beat till it is smooth. Add one well-beaten
egg and beat to a smooth batter.
Spread in a cake pan and let it stand twenty
minutes. Pour over it a mixture of two tablespoonfuls
of sugar, one teaspoonful of cinnamon,
and two tablespoonfuls of cream.
Sprinkle a little flour or cake crumbs over it
and bake in a hotter oven than for bread.</p>

<p>Maple sugar pounded till fine can be used
and makes a delicious cake.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">BREADS AND BISCUITS MADE<br />
WITH YEAST</h2></div>


<h3><i>Whole Wheat Bread</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> any one of the sponges after they have
risen, add enough whole wheat flour to make
a dough that can be kneaded. Set it to rise
in a warm place protected from draughts.
When risen to double its bulk turn out on a
bread board and work only enough to form
into loaves. Let these rise to half double their
bulk and bake for an hour in a moderate
oven. If the loaves are large they should bake
longer.</p>

<p>The oat flour sponge is especially good.</p>


<h3><i>Graham Bread</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> any of the sponges add four cups of
graham meal and finish with whole wheat
flour. If a coarser bread is desired, add
one cup of bran and only three cups of the
meal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>Whole Wheat and Apple Sauce Bread</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> two cups of whole wheat sponge add one
cup of apple sauce that has been sweetened
and enough whole wheat flour to make a stiff
dough. Proceed as for whole wheat bread.</p>

<p>A cup of sifted squash may be used in
place of the apple sauce or one cup of beans
that have been put through a sieve, in fact
almost any vegetable can be used in this
proportion.</p>


<h3><i>Nut and Fruit Loaf</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> two cups of any sponge add two cups of
graham meal, one cup of chopped or broken
nuts, and one dozen dates sliced. Add enough
whole wheat flour so that it can be handled.
Let it rise to double its bulk and then form
into a loaf, let it rise, and bake.</p>


<h3><i>Nut Loaf</i></h3>

whole wheat flour to keep it from sticking to
the board. It will take nearly two cups, for
the combination of rye and corn meal makes
a very sticky dough, and the bread will be
sticky unless the dough is kneaded till very
stiff. Set it to rise till it has doubled its bulk,
and then form into loaves. Let these rise till
they have a little more than half doubled
their bulk, and bake in a moderate oven one
and one half hours.</p>

<p>If the oven is too hot and the crust is hard,

out. It should be kneaded from the outside
to the center until smooth and velvety&mdash;about
ten minutes. Cover the dish with a

When it has trebled its size, knead it thoroughly
again for ten minutes and let it rise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
again. After this each time it rises push it

half an inch thick. Cut into four-inch squares
and then cut these once across into triangles.
These must be carefully rolled, beginning

point to keep it from unrolling and put in a
pan curving them to form a crescent. Let
them rise again, and just before putting in the
oven brush them over with the white of an
egg slightly beaten with a teaspoonful of
water.</p>

<h3><i>My Favorite Corn Bread</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Take</span> one and a quarter cups of corn meal.
Pour over this one and a quarter cups of <i>boiling</i>
water and stir till it thickens. Add two
teaspoonfuls of shortening, one teaspoonful
of salt, one half cup of milk, and one well-beaten
egg. Beat well, and just before putting
into the pan sift in three teaspoonfuls of
baking powder. Mix lightly and bake at
once.</p>

<p>If the water is not boiling, the bread will
be a failure.</p>


<h3><i>White Corn Muffins</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Take</span> one cup of bolted meal, and one cup of
<i>boiling</i> water. Stir till stiff. Add two teaspoonfuls
of shortening, one teaspoonful of
salt, and one well-beaten egg, and last two
teaspoonfuls of baking powder. Bake in hot
muffin pans.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>The dough will be quite stiff when put into
the pans, but will be delicate when cooked.</p>


<h3><i>Afternoon Tea Muffins</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Use</span> the above recipe and bake in very small
pans. When baked break open a little on one
side and put in a bit of butter and serve at
once.</p>


<h3><i>Luncheon Corn Bread</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Put</span> two tablespoonfuls of shortening, preferably
bacon fat, in a bread loaf pan and set it
in the oven to get hot. Beat one egg light,
and add one half cup of milk or water and
one cup of corn meal, two teaspoonfuls of
baking powder and one half teaspoonful of
salt. Beat well and pour in the melted shortening.
Beat again and put into the pan in
which the shortening was melted. Lay thin
slices of bacon on top of the dough and bake
in a moderate oven.</p>


<h3><i>Corn Meal Muffins</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Put</span> one cup of milk and one of water in the
double boiler, and when it is scalding stir in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
gradually one cup of corn meal. Stir till
smooth and let it cook ten minutes. Add
two teaspoonfuls of shortening and one of
salt, and set it aside till cool. Then add the
well-beaten yolks of two eggs, one teaspoonful
of baking powder, and the beaten whites
of the eggs. Bake in hot muffin pans.</p>


<h3><i>New England Spider Corn Bread</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Take</span> one and one quarter cups of granulated
corn meal, one teaspoonful of soda,
and one teaspoonful of salt. Sift together
and add two well-beaten eggs and two cups
of sour milk or buttermilk. Put two tablespoonfuls
of shortening in an iron frying-pan
and set it on the top of the stove to melt.
When hot pour in the corn mixture and set
the pan back on the stove. Pour over it
gently without mixing one cupful of cold
sweet milk. Bake on the middle grate of
the oven for about half an hour. It will be
creamy when done. Run a knife round the
edge of the frying-pan to loosen the cake
and turn it over on to a cover. Put a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
plate over it and reverse it and the cake is
right side up and unbroken. Do not cut it

<h3><i>Cereal and Corn Bread</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> one well-beaten egg add one and a quarter
cups of buttermilk or sour milk. Sift together

cooked rice or any cooked cereal. Bake in
two layer cake pans for half an hour. Take
from the pans and pile one on the other,
spreading butter between. Serve hot.</p>

<p>This can be made with sweet milk by substituting
two teaspoonfuls of baking powder
for the soda. It will make sixteen muffins if
preferred that way.</p>

<p>Always use a little baking powder with
the soda and sour milk; it makes the bread
lighter.</p>

flour and add it to the corn meal. The meal
still being hot the mixture will be foamy.
Add enough more flour to make a stiff dough
and drop from a spoon on a buttered pan and

Work in with two knives or with the fingers
two tablespoonfuls of butter substitute or

butter. Pour over this two and one half cups
of boiling water and stir till it thickens.

salt and two tablespoonfuls of thick cream.
Mix well and put in spoonfuls on a well-buttered

have been followed, they will be stiff enough
so it will be necessary to spread them with a
knife to make them no more than half an
inch thick. Before turning spread a little
butter on the uncooked side or they will
stick. It will take half an hour to cook them.
These are delicious.</p>

frying-pan, browning on both sides. Put a

it is melted let it run well over the pan before
putting in the cake.</p>

<p>The cakes will be whiter if rice flour is

well-beaten egg, one half teaspoonful of soda
and the same of salt. Sift one teaspoonful
of baking powder with half a cup of whole
wheat flour and add to the batter with
enough more flour to make a batter that will
just hold its shape for a good griddle cake. If
sweet milk is used omit the soda and add one
more teaspoonful of baking powder. This is
my favorite recipe.</p>


<h3><i>Corn Meal Griddle Cakes</i> (<i>2</i>)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Scald</span> two cups of milk in the double boiler
and stir in one cup of coarse corn meal. Cook

<h3><i>Bread Griddle Cakes</i></h3>

separate the halves into quarters, and then
into eighths. If the loaf is large, these pieces
can be divided again. Cover a large pan or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
biscuit sheet with paper, lay the bread upon
it, and put in a moderate oven for half an
hour or until it is dry and a golden brown.
It must be crisp to the center.</p>

<p>This will keep some weeks in a tin box, but
should be freshened in the oven before using.</p>


<h3><i>Deviled Toast</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cut</span> any dark bread into thin slices and
toast a golden brown. Mix well together one
tablespoonful of butter, one quarter of a teaspoonful

into the dry mixture till it makes a soft dough.
Turn on to a floured board and knead for a
minute, then roll out half an inch thick. Cut
out the size of a breakfast plate and cook
on a moderately hot griddle that has been
lightly greased. When brown turn and cook
on the other side. When done cut each cake
into quarters and turn up so as to brown the
cut edges. Split and butter and serve hot.</p>

<p>This can be cut in rounds with a biscuit
cutter and cooked the same way.</p>


<h3><i>A Paste to put on Buns when half baked</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mix</span> two teaspoonfuls of cornstarch with

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
