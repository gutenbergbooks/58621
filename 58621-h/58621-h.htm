<h2 class="nobreak">FOREWORD</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> the last twenty years the housewives
of our country have been more and more depending
upon the bakers for the bread used
in the homes. In some of our cities the home-baked
loaf is hardly known.</p>

<p>Although the commercial bread has been
of great variety and of excellent quality, it
has never been an economical method of
serving the family with the staff of life.</p>

<p>By depending upon ready-baked bread we
have come to consider it a difficult process to
make good yeast bread and almost a hardship
to try to have home-made bread.</p>

<p>I had fallen into the habit of buying my
bread; my family was so small that it hardly
seemed necessary to insist that bread should
be made in my kitchen when good bread
could be bought at a reasonable price. The
result was that when the call came to conserve
the wheat, I resorted almost entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
to quick breads made with baking powder or
with sour milk and soda. However, the experiments
that I made with these materials
proved so interesting and satisfactory that
I decided to see what I could do with a yeast cake
and other grains than wheat.</p>

<p>My first experiments were failures and I
was discouraged because, instead of saving
food, I was wasting it, and yet I was unwilling
to acknowledge myself defeated by the
little square of leaven that came to me so
attractively done up in tinfoil.</p>

<p>After careful consideration I decided that
I had rushed into undue intimacy with a force
of which I had very little understanding and
that I might do better if I cultivated the acquaintance
by degrees.</p>

<p>My next experiments were made with a
very simple sponge of whole wheat flour,
water, and yeast, which I allowed to rise for
about four hours. I divided it into four parts,
and to one I added scalded corn meal and
rye flour; to the second, raw corn meal and
whole wheat flour; to the third, barley flour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
and rye; and to the fourth, rice flour. I put
salt in each lot, but no sugar or shortening.
As I worked I kept a paper and pencil beside
me and made careful notes of everything I
did, also of results that I expected and of any
doubts that occurred to me as to the wisdom
of what I was doing. The four little loaves
that resulted taught me many things and
were the beginning of experiments that
lasted through the summer&mdash;experiments
that any housekeeper could make, for I had
no laboratory, only the kitchen of my country
house and the utensils found in every
house.</p>

<p>In giving the results of my summer&#8217;s work I
have tried to make the recipes so simple and
yet explicit that the most inexperienced cook
can follow them.</p>

AND CAKES</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<h2 class="nobreak">YEASTS</h2></div>


<h3><i>Buttermilk Dry Yeast</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Put</span> one quart of buttermilk in a double
boiler, and when it is scalding hot add one
and one half quarts of corn meal and one
teaspoonful of salt, and stir well. Let this
mush cool, and then add one yeast cake that
has been dissolved in one half cup of lukewarm
water. Set the mixture in a warm
place, and when it rises stir it down and let
it rise again. Repeat this process three times,
and then add more corn meal and enough
whole wheat flour to bind it so that it can
be made into cakes. Use a rounding tablespoonful
to each cake if they are to be used
in winter, less if for summer use. Let them
dry as quickly as possible, but do not put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
them in the oven or in the sun. A rack hung
high over the stove is a good place to dry
them. They should have a sour, but not disagreeable,
smell. These will keep all summer
on a dry pantry shelf.</p>


<h3><i>Potato and Hop Dry Yeast</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Boil</span> together four small potatoes and one
half cup, packed, of dry hops, using three
pints of water. When the potatoes are done,
take them out and put through a sieve or
ricer. Add two cups of whole wheat flour and
mix well. Strain the boiling hop water over
this mixture and beat till it is a smooth batter.
Add one tablespoonful of salt and the
same of ginger and one half cup of sugar.
When lukewarm, add one yeast cake that
has been dissolved in one cup of lukewarm
water. Let this stand one or two days, the
time depending upon the temperature of
the room, stirring it down occasionally.
When it smells good and sour, add corn meal
till it is thick enough to handle. Make into
cakes, using a rounded tablespoonful if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
are to be used in winter and less for summer
use. Dry quickly, but do not put in the oven
or in the sun. It will take a few days before
they are dry enough to put away. These
will keep in a box on a dry pantry shelf winter
or summer.</p>

<p>One cake is equal to a cake of compressed
yeast.</p>


<h3><i>Continental Dry Yeast</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> putting the bread in pans save out
a pint of the dough. Roll this half an inch
thick, put it on plates, and leave it on the
pantry shelf, turning it occasionally. It will
become quite sour as it dries. After a few
days the drying may be hastened, but do
not overheat it or the yeast plant will be
killed. When dry, break it into convenient
pieces and put in a box or jar. To use, break
into small pieces, enough to half fill a cup
and soak till soft in lukewarm water. Use
like any yeast. I have had satisfactory results
using this yeast for raising a sponge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>Liquid Yeast</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> will keep one or two weeks in summer
and five or six in winter if not allowed to
freeze. Scalding or freezing kills the yeast
plant.</p>

<p>Add one cup of dry hops to two quarts of
boiling water and boil gently for fifteen minutes.
In the meantime peel and grate five
large potatoes into enough water to cover
them; this is to prevent them from turning
dark. Add one cup of sugar, one tablespoonful
of salt, and the same of ginger. Put this
mixture into a saucepan and pour over it
the water in which the hops have boiled.
Cook, stirring all the time till it thickens,
turn into a perfectly clean crock or jar, and
when lukewarm add two cups of good yeast
or two yeast cakes that have been dissolved
in two cups of lukewarm water. Keep the
jar where it is moderately warm and stir
the yeast down as often as it rises. When
fermentation stops, it will be quite thin. It
should then be covered closely and put in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
cool place. It is good as long as it smells
sour but does not taste so. When yeast loses
its smell it has no more rising power; in
other words, the yeast plant is dead.</p>

<p>One half cup of this yeast is equal to one
cake of compressed yeast.</p>

<p>The potatoes may be boiled and mashed
through a sieve, but practical bread-makers
say that the grated potatoes make the best
yeast.</p>

<hr class="chap" />





<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">SUGGESTIONS<br />
FOR THE MAKING OF BREAD<br />
WITHOUT WHITE FLOUR</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Breads</span> made with little or no wheat to be
successful must be treated in a different way
from white flour breads. If there is cooked
cereal in the dough it must be made much
stiffer than for ordinary bread. All dark
breads must be well risen in the dough, but
must not rise to double their bulk after putting
in the pans; only to half double. The
oven should not be as hot as for white bread;
it should be at a temperature so that a small
loaf will not be overdone in an hour and a
quarter.</p>

<p>When possible use milk, or at least part
milk, for the liquid in making the sponge; the
dough will use less flour and require less
kneading and the bread will have greater
food value. The milk must be scalded and
cooled or it may sour as the dough rises. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
corn meal is to be scalded with the milk, it is
better to stir the meal into the milk when
it is in the saucepan on the stove rather than
to pour the hot milk over the meal.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t make the mistake of having the
dark loaf sweet. One tires very soon of a
sweet bread as the staff of life.</p>

<p>In using recipes for these new breads it
is necessary to remember that at the present
time there is no standard for these meals
and flours that we are using. There are
many good kinds on the market that differ
in the amount of liquid that they will take up.</p>

<p>In none of the recipes calling for whole
wheat flour do I refer to flour with bran in
it. Whole wheat, rye, oat, barley, and rice
flour should be fine enough to go through a
fine flour sieve; otherwise they should be
called meals.</p>

<p>Corn flour and the very fine bolted meal
are as fine as the whole wheat flour and cannot
be used for the recipes calling for corn
meal. The coarser bolted meal can be
treated as the fine granulated meal.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>In making yeast bread always have the
liquid lukewarm, and in cold weather it facilitates
matters to warm the flour.</p>

<p>Never let sponge or dough get chilled
until it has risen once; after that it can be
put in the ice box to check fermentation till
it is needed to make into rolls or coffee
bread.</p>

<p>Thick stoneware is the best material for
a mixing-bowl for yeast bread, but it is heavy
to handle. If the sponge or dough is set to
rise in a tin dish it should be well wrapped
in a thick cloth to keep the dough at an
even temperature. Both sponge and dough
will stand a good deal of hard treatment, but
the bread-making will be slow and the result
poor.</p>

<p>A bread-mixer is a great labor-saver, but
there should be a thick cloth cover to be used
with it.</p>

<p>The rising of dough may be hastened by
setting the dish in a pan of warm water and
adding more from time to time to keep up
the temperature.</p>

<hr class="chap" />





<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">SPONGES</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">All</span> foreign bakers use the sponge method
for their best breads and rolls and refer to
that made from the straight dough as &#8220;off-hand
bread.&#8221;</p>

<p>They reasonably claim that it has many
advantages; that the bread made from a
sponge has a better flavor, requires less
shortening and less yeast, keeps moist longer,
and is more velvety in texture.</p>

<p>It is a more convenient method, for although
the sponge will rise in four hours it
can stand longer than the straight dough
without deterioration, and many kinds of
bread, coffee cake, and rolls can be made from
one sponge.</p>

<p>All dark breads have a more attractive color
if one tablespoonful of dark molasses is added
to the sponge, but this hastens the rising; so,
if the sponge is to stand overnight, do not
add it till morning when the bread is mixed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>Salt retards the rising, so it is better in cold
weather to add that when the bread is made
up.</p>


<h3><i>Whole Wheat Sponge</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Scald</span> three cups of milk and let it stand till
it is lukewarm. Add one teaspoonful of salt
and one tablespoonful of molasses and one
yeast cake that has been dissolved in one
half cup of warm water. Stir in enough whole
wheat flour to make a drop batter. Beat well
and put it in a covered dish to rise. Use as
directed in the bread recipes. Water can be
used in place of milk.</p>


<h3><i>Potato Sponge</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mash</span> or put through a ricer enough hot
boiled potatoes to make two cupfuls. Add
two cups of whole wheat flour and mix well.
Pour over this two cups of the water in which
the potatoes were boiled; this should be hot
enough to thoroughly scald the mixture. Add
one tablespoonful of molasses and two teaspoonfuls
of salt. Stir till it is a smooth
batter. If this is to be made into a sponge at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
once, add one cup of cold water, and when
the batter is lukewarm add one yeast cake
that has been dissolved in one cup of lukewarm
water. Set it to rise four hours.</p>

<p>The potato and flour mixture may be made
and scalded at any time that it is convenient
to cook the potatoes and can stand until it is
wanted for the sponge. If it has become cold,
add one cup of water hot enough to make the
mixture lukewarm and proceed as directed
with the yeast.</p>


<h3><i>Corn Meal Sponge</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Boil</span> four medium-sized potatoes in one
quart of water. When done pour three cups
of the boiling potato water over one and one
half cups of corn meal and stir till it is smooth.
Add one and one half cups of the potato that
has been mashed or put through a ricer, one
tablespoonful of salt, and one of molasses.
When this is lukewarm, add one yeast cake
that has been dissolved in one cup of lukewarm
water. Set it to rise and use as directed
in the recipes for sponge bread.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>Oat Flour Sponge</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Take</span> one and one half cups of hot mashed
potato, two cups of sifted oat flour, mix well,
and scald with two cups of the boiling water
in which the potatoes were cooked. Add one
tablespoonful of molasses and one of salt.
When cool, add one yeast cake that has been
dissolved in one cup of lukewarm water.</p>


<h3><i>Oatmeal Sponge</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Pour</span> two cups of boiling water over two cups
of rolled oats and let it stand covered for two
hours. Add two cups of whole wheat flour
and one cup of water hot enough to make the
mixture lukewarm. Stir well and add one
tablespoonful of salt and the same of molasses.
Add one yeast cake dissolved in one
cup of lukewarm water and set to rise.</p>


<h3><i>Four Varieties of Bread from one Potato
Sponge</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the potato sponge is light and foamy,
put one third of it aside. To the other two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
thirds add enough whole wheat flour to make
a soft dough, but one that can be handled.
Knead till it is smooth and velvety. Set it to
rise. When it has doubled its bulk knead
a little and divide it in two. Make a loaf
of one part, and when it has half doubled
its bulk bake in a moderate oven for an
hour.</p>

<p>Roll the remaining dough into a strip half
an inch thick. Spread with brown or white
sugar, using a half cupful. Sprinkle one teaspoonful
of cinnamon over the sugar and lay
on a few raisins. Roll up carefully and put
into a bread pan to rise till it has half doubled
its bulk. Bake in a moderate oven. If the
sheet of dough is kept as wide as the bread
pan is long, this will fit in and when it is cut
the spiral of sugar and cinnamon will show
to perfection.</p>

<p>To the remaining sponge add rye flour till
it is stiff enough to handle, rather a stiff
dough. Set it to rise, and when doubled its
bulk make all but one and one half cups of
the dough into a small loaf and let it rise till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
it has half doubled its bulk. Bake an hour
in a moderate oven.</p>

<p>To make coffee cake from the remaining
dough, first cream together one tablespoonful
of shortening with two tablespoonfuls of
sugar. Cut this into the dough with a knife
and beat till it is smooth. Add one well-beaten
egg and beat to a smooth batter.
Spread in a cake pan and let it stand twenty
minutes. Pour over it a mixture of two tablespoonfuls
of sugar, one teaspoonful of cinnamon,
and two tablespoonfuls of cream.
Sprinkle a little flour or cake crumbs over it
and bake in a hotter oven than for bread.</p>

<p>Maple sugar pounded till fine can be used
and makes a delicious cake.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">BREADS AND BISCUITS MADE<br />
WITH YEAST</h2></div>


<h3><i>Whole Wheat Bread</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> any one of the sponges after they have
risen, add enough whole wheat flour to make
a dough that can be kneaded. Set it to rise
in a warm place protected from draughts.
When risen to double its bulk turn out on a
bread board and work only enough to form
into loaves. Let these rise to half double their
bulk and bake for an hour in a moderate
oven. If the loaves are large they should bake
longer.</p>

<p>The oat flour sponge is especially good.</p>


<h3><i>Graham Bread</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> any of the sponges add four cups of
graham meal and finish with whole wheat
flour. If a coarser bread is desired, add
one cup of bran and only three cups of the
meal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>Whole Wheat and Apple Sauce Bread</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> two cups of whole wheat sponge add one
cup of apple sauce that has been sweetened
and enough whole wheat flour to make a stiff
dough. Proceed as for whole wheat bread.</p>

<p>A cup of sifted squash may be used in
place of the apple sauce or one cup of beans
that have been put through a sieve, in fact
almost any vegetable can be used in this
proportion.</p>


<h3><i>Nut and Fruit Loaf</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> two cups of any sponge add two cups of
graham meal, one cup of chopped or broken
nuts, and one dozen dates sliced. Add enough
whole wheat flour so that it can be handled.
Let it rise to double its bulk and then form
into a loaf, let it rise, and bake.</p>


<h3><i>Nut Loaf</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Take</span> enough of any risen bread dough to
make a loaf. Roll it into a sheet half an inch
thick. Scatter chopped nuts over it and roll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
up and put in the pan to rise. This distributes
the nuts evenly and makes a very attractive
slice with the curling line of nuts.</p>


<h3><i>Rye Flour Bread</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> either the potato or the whole wheat
sponge add enough sifted rye flour to make
a dough that can be handled. Turn out on to
the board and knead well, using whole wheat
flour to keep it from sticking. When smooth
and velvety set it to rise till it has doubled
its bulk. Form into loaves, and when half
doubled its bulk bake in a moderate oven for
an hour and a half.</p>


<h3><i>Rye Meal Bread</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is made like rye flour bread, only first
adding four cups of rye meal to the sponge
and finishing with rye flour.</p>


<h3><i>Rye and Corn Meal Bread</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> the corn meal sponge add a second tablespoonful
of molasses and enough rye flour to
make a very stiff dough. Knead well, using<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
whole wheat flour to keep it from sticking to
the board. It will take nearly two cups, for
the combination of rye and corn meal makes
a very sticky dough, and the bread will be
sticky unless the dough is kneaded till very
stiff. Set it to rise till it has doubled its bulk,
and then form into loaves. Let these rise till
they have a little more than half doubled
their bulk, and bake in a moderate oven one
and one half hours.</p>

<p>If the oven is too hot and the crust is hard,
wrap the loaf in a wet cloth and over that a
dry one.</p>

<p>For the wheatless days use rye flour to
knead instead of the whole wheat.</p>

pieces the size of an egg and roll in the hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
till smooth and make them egg-shaped. Put
in a pan so they do not touch each other and

<h3><i>Whole Wheat Vienna Crescents</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> pint of hot water, two tablespoonfuls of
shortening, one tablespoonful of sugar, and

the well-beaten yolk of an egg and a large
half of a yeast cake that has been dissolved
in one half cupful of lukewarm water. Mix
well and add all the whole wheat flour that
can be kneaded into it. This can be kneaded
in an earthenware bowl with sloping sides
and never be put on the board till it is rolled
out. It should be kneaded from the outside
to the center until smooth and velvety&mdash;about
ten minutes. Cover the dish with a
tin cover and then a cloth and set to rise.
When it has trebled its size, knead it thoroughly
again for ten minutes and let it rise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
again. After this each time it rises push it
down until it is time to make into rolls.</p>

<p>Turn the dough on to the board and roll
half an inch thick. Cut into four-inch squares
and then cut these once across into triangles.
These must be carefully rolled, beginning
with the long side and rolling till the point is
reached. Put a drop of water under the
point to keep it from unrolling and put in a
pan curving them to form a crescent. Let
them rise again, and just before putting in the
oven brush them over with the white of an
egg slightly beaten with a teaspoonful of
water.</p>

<p>These can be made into &#8220;Pocketbook
Rolls&#8221; by cutting the four-inch squares in
two-lengths ways and folding twice, putting
a bit of butter between.</p>


<h3><i>Biscuits</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Take</span> two cups of risen dough and add one
tablespoonful of shortening. Knead well and
form into biscuits. To have every biscuit
an outside one, invert a greased bowl in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
middle of a round pan and put the biscuits
about it.</p>

<p>For rolls the dough may be rolled out and
cut with a round cutter and folded as for
Parker House Rolls.</p>


<h3><i>Potato Rolls</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Peel</span> and boil till soft four large potatoes and
mash till smooth, or better, put them through
a ricer. Add two tablespoonfuls of shortening,

egg, two cups of scalded milk cooled till it is
lukewarm, and two cups of light whole wheat
sponge. Add enough whole wheat flour to
knead; don&#8217;t make it too stiff. Knead well
and set to rise. When very light turn on to
the board and roll out. Cut with a biscuit
cutter and put close together in a pan. When
very light bake in a hot oven about twenty-five
minutes.</p>

<p>These can be made into balls the size of a
large marble and three put in each muffin
pan. Set to rise and bake. They will be
clover leaf rolls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>Supper Rolls</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> one pint of scalded milk, add one large
tablespoonful of shortening, two teaspoonfuls
of salt, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, and set
to cool. Dissolve one yeast cake in one half
cup of lukewarm water and add to the mixture
when it is lukewarm. Add as much
whole wheat flour as is needed to make a
dough stiff enough to stir, but not stiff
enough to knead. Beat well and set to rise
about ten in the morning. If it rises well beat
it down during the day. About an hour and
a half before supper beat it down and turn on
to the bread board. Do not knead, but roll
it out and cut into biscuits. Put close together
in a pan and allow them to get very
light and bake in a good oven.</p>


<h3><i>Corn Rolls</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> one cup of corn meal add gradually, stirring

one half of a yeast cake that has been dissolved
in half a cup of warm water. Let it
rise overnight, and in the morning add a
pinch of soda and enough whole wheat flour
to make a dough stiff enough to handle.
Knead well. Break off pieces of the dough
and roll round in the hands till smooth and
velvety. Put in a greased pan and let them
rise till light. Bake in a moderate oven.</p>

<p>To have all outside biscuit use a round pan
and invert a bowl in the center. Grease the
bowl and put the biscuits round it.</p>


<h3><i>Raised Oatmeal Muffins</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Pour</span> over one cup of rolled oats two cups of
boiling water and let stand covered till lukewarm.
Add half a cup of molasses, one teaspoonful
of salt, and half a yeast cake that
has been dissolved in half a cup of warm
water. Mix with enough rye flour to make a
stiff dough, as stiff as can be beaten. Beat

beat again well and put in muffin pans. Let
them double their size and then bake.</p>

Add enough whole wheat flour to make a
very soft dough. Beat well and allow to rise
till light, overnight if desired. Beat again
and half fill muffin rings that have been
greased and set on a cold greased griddle. Set
the griddle on the back of the stove or where
it will warm slowly. When the muffins begin
to rise, move the griddle where it will get hot.
When they are brown on one side, turn
muffin, ring and all, and bake till brown. Do
not bake too quickly.</p>

<p>These can be eaten at once or left till cold,
split and toasted. The latter is the usual
way of serving them.</p>


<h3><i>Plain Coffee Cake</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cream</span> a tablespoonful of shortening with
two of sugar. When well blended add two
tablespoonfuls of cream or milk. Beat this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
into a cup and a half of bread dough, using a
knife instead of a spoon; beat till it is a
smooth batter and turn into a well-greased
shallow pan. Let it stand twenty minutes;
then spread with a mixture of brown sugar
and milk and sprinkle over it a teaspoonful
of cinnamon and a tablespoonful of flour.</p>


<h3><i>Apple Cake</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the coffee cake is in the pan set pieces
of apple thickly over it and cover with sugar,
sprinkle with cinnamon and nutmeg to suit
the taste.</p>


<h3><i>Peach Cake</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Use</span> peaches instead of apples and omit the
spice.</p>

<p>Thin breads and rolls need a hotter oven
than loaves.</p>


<h3><i>Rye Crumpets</i> (<i>1</i>)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Take</span> one cup of the potato sponge, one well-beaten
egg, one tablespoonful of shortening,
and one half teaspoonful of salt. Beat together
with a knife till it is smooth, and then
add rye flour till it is a soft dough, too thick
to pour but too thin to handle. Put it in the
ice box, and one hour before they are to be
cooked take it out and set in a warm place to
rise. Grease a cold griddle and muffin rings,
half fill the rings with the dough, and set the
griddle over a moderate fire. As the griddle
heats the muffins will rise and be well risen
when they begin to bake. When well
browned on one side turn muffin, ring and
all. These are good when fresh made and are
very good split and toasted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

and add one half cup of milk or water and
one cup of corn meal, two teaspoonfuls of
baking powder and one half teaspoonful of
salt. Beat well and pour in the melted shortening.
Beat again and put into the pan in
which the shortening was melted. Lay thin
slices of bacon on top of the dough and bake

<h3><i>Corn Meal Muffins</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Put</span> one cup of milk and one of water in the
double boiler, and when it is scalding stir in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
gradually one cup of corn meal. Stir till

well-beaten yolks of two eggs, one teaspoonful
of baking powder, and the beaten whites
of the eggs. Bake in hot muffin pans.</p>


<h3><i>New England Spider Corn Bread</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Take</span> one and one quarter cups of granulated
corn meal, one teaspoonful of soda,
and one teaspoonful of salt. Sift together
and add two well-beaten eggs and two cups
of sour milk or buttermilk. Put two tablespoonfuls
of shortening in an iron frying-pan
and set it on the top of the stove to melt.
When hot pour in the corn mixture and set
the pan back on the stove. Pour over it
gently without mixing one cupful of cold
sweet milk. Bake on the middle grate of
the oven for about half an hour. It will be
creamy when done. Run a knife round the
edge of the frying-pan to loosen the cake
and turn it over on to a cover. Put a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>

two layer cake pans for half an hour. Take
from the pans and pile one on the other,
spreading butter between. Serve hot.</p>

<p>This can be made with sweet milk by substituting
two teaspoonfuls of baking powder
for the soda. It will make sixteen muffins if
preferred that way.</p>

<p>Always use a little baking powder with
the soda and sour milk; it makes the bread
lighter.</p>

cutter and bake in a brisk oven, about twenty
minutes.</p>


<h3><i>Barley Biscuit</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Sift</span> together one cup of barley flour, one cup
of whole wheat flour, one teaspoonful of salt,
and four teaspoonfuls of baking powder.
Work in with two knives or with the fingers
two tablespoonfuls of butter substitute or
drippings. Add enough milk, about three
fourths cup, to make a dough that can be
handled. Roll out three fourths of an inch
thick and bake in a good oven twenty-five
minutes.</p>


<h3><i>Oatmeal Muffins</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> one cup of scalding milk add three fourths
cup of rolled oats. Let them stand five minutes.
Add one tablespoonful of shortening,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
one teaspoonful of salt, one and a half cups
of whole wheat flour, in which have been

and last of all one well-beaten egg. Bake in
hot gem pans.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cream</span> one tablespoonful of shortening with
one cup of sugar. Add one well-beaten egg
and beat well. Add one cup of milk and four
cups of whole wheat flour, four teaspoonfuls
of baking powder, and two cups of floured
berries. Put in large shallow pan, sprinkle
sugar over the top. Bake in good oven.</p>


<h3><i>Rye and Indian Puffs</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mix</span> together two thirds of a cup of corn meal
and the same of rye meal, one teaspoonful of
sugar, half a teaspoonful of salt. Beat the
yolk of one egg very light and add it to one
cup of milk. Add this gradually to the meal
mixture and beat well. Beat the white of the
egg till dry and fold it in quickly. Bake at
once in hot muffin pans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>Old-Fashioned &#8220;Scalt Cake&#8221;</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Take</span> two cups of bolted corn meal, two teaspoonfuls
of salt, and one teaspoonful of
butter. Pour over this two and one half cups

Spread it half an inch thick on a hot buttered
griddle and cook twenty minutes.
Spread the top with softened butter and turn
the cake and bake twenty minutes on the
other side.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Put</span> into a bowl one and one half cups of corn
meal, one teaspoonful of sugar, one teaspoonful

salt and two tablespoonfuls of thick cream.
Mix well and put in spoonfuls on a well-buttered
and hot griddle. If all the directions
have been followed, they will be stiff enough
so it will be necessary to spread them with a
knife to make them no more than half an
inch thick. Before turning spread a little
butter on the uncooked side or they will
stick. It will take half an hour to cook them.
These are delicious.</p>


<h3><i>Whole Wheat Biscuit</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Take</span> two cups of whole wheat flour, four
teaspoonfuls of baking powder, and one teaspoonful
of salt sifted together. Work in
three tablespoonfuls of shortening and add

wheat flour and the same amount of milk to
a smooth batter. Add two well-beaten eggs
and half a teaspoonful of salt. Beat hard with
an egg-beater for a few minutes and half fill
the hot cups. These need quite a hot oven,
but if it is too hot at first they will bake before
they pop.</p>


<h3><i>Whole Wheat Muffins</i> (<i>1</i>)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cream</span> one quarter of a cup of shortening
with one quarter of a cup of sugar. Add one
well-beaten egg. Sift together one and a half

and one third cups of milk and one well-beaten
egg; add last of all three tablespoonfuls of
melted shortening. Bake in muffin pans.</p>

No shortening is necessary.</p>


<h3><i>Oatmeal Muffins</i> (<i>2</i>)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Soak</span> two cups of rolled oats overnight in
one and one half cups of sour milk. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
morning add one tablespoonful of melted
shortening, one tablespoonful of sugar, one
well-beaten egg, one teaspoonful of soda,

<p>When cooked cereal is used, it is difficult
to say just how much liquid to use because
the cereal may be more or less moist.</p>


<h3><i>Rye Muffins</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Sift</span> together one cup of rye flour, three teaspoonfuls
of baking powder, and one half
teaspoonful of salt. Add one cup of rye meal

<p>If a richer muffin is desired add one tablespoonful
of shortening and a well-beaten egg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>Rye Popovers</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> have popovers pop they must be baked in
either thick stoneware cups or in thick iron
or aluminum muffin pans which should be
cup-shaped.</p>

<p>Sift together one teaspoonful of sugar, one
teaspoonful of salt, and one and a half cups
of rye flour. Stir in gradually one and a half

for three minutes. Half fill hissing
hot muffin cups and bake in a hot oven.</p>

dough. Drop by spoonfuls upon a baking
sheet and bake in a brisk oven.</p>


<h3><i>Sweet Potato Biscuits</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> three quarters of a cup of sweet potato
that has been cooked and rubbed through a
sieve add two cups of whole wheat flour, one

<h2 class="nobreak">PANCAKES</h2></div>


<h3><i>Potato Pancakes</i> (<i>1</i>)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Put</span> eight raw potatoes through a meat
chopper and season with salt and pepper.
Fry in large thin cakes on a well-greased
griddle, turning to brown both sides. Butter
and roll each cake and serve hot.</p>


<h3><i>Potato Pancakes</i> (<i>2</i>)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Put</span> enough raw potato through the meat
chopper to make three cupfuls. Add three
tablespoonfuls of whole wheat flour, one teaspoonful
of salt, and one (or two) well-beaten
eggs. Beat well and bake in a well-greased
frying-pan, browning on both sides. Put a
teaspoonful of fat in the frying-pan and when
it is melted let it run well over the pan before
putting in the cake.</p>

<p>The cakes will be whiter if rice flour is
used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>Corn Meal Griddle Cakes</i> (<i>1</i>)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Take</span> one cup of corn meal, pour over it one
cup of <i>boiling</i> water, and stir till it thickens.
Add one cup of sour milk or buttermilk, one
well-beaten egg, one half teaspoonful of soda
and the same of salt. Sift one teaspoonful
of baking powder with half a cup of whole
wheat flour and add to the batter with
enough more flour to make a batter that will
just hold its shape for a good griddle cake. If
sweet milk is used omit the soda and add one
more teaspoonful of baking powder. This is
my favorite recipe.</p>


<h3><i>Corn Meal Griddle Cakes</i> (<i>2</i>)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Scald</span> two cups of milk in the double boiler
and stir in one cup of coarse corn meal. Cook
ten minutes and take from the fire. Add one
teaspoonful of butter or shortening of some
sort and let it cool. Add two well-beaten eggs
and enough cold milk to make a batter that
will just pour. Add one teaspoonful of baking
powder and bake on a hot griddle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>Rice Griddle Cakes</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> one and a half cups of cold cooked rice
add one well-beaten egg and one cup of sour
milk or buttermilk. Sift together one half
teaspoonful of salt, one half teaspoonful of
soda, one teaspoonful of baking powder, and
one half cup of rye flour. Add this to the rice
and egg; if not stiff enough add more flour.</p>

<p>If it is necessary to use sweet milk omit the
soda and add one more teaspoonful of baking
powder.</p>


<h3><i>Bread Griddle Cakes</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cover</span> two cups of stale bread of any kind
with two cups of sour milk and let it stand
for half an hour. If the bread is very hard
it may need longer soaking. Add one well-beaten
egg, one half teaspoonful of salt, and
enough whole wheat or rye flour to make a
batter that will just pour, about three quarters
of a cupful. When ready to bake add one
teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a little cold
water, one teaspoonful of baking powder, and
beat well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>Corn Meal Puffs</i> (<i>for dessert</i>)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mix</span> two cups of corn flour (fine bolted meal
will do) and half a cup of whole wheat flour
and one teaspoonful of salt. Stir this into one
quart of boiling milk and cook in the double
boiler for fifteen minutes, keeping it stirred.
Put in a bowl and add one tablespoonful of
butter and beat well. When cold add one cup
of powdered sugar and four eggs beaten light,
a little cinnamon and nutmeg, and two teaspoonfuls
of baking powder. Beat well and
bake in greased muffin pans. Serve with a
pudding sauce.</p>

<p>Half this recipe will be enough for five
people.</p>


<h3><i>Pulled Bread</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Use</span> a loaf of whole wheat bread not more
than twenty-four hours old. Cut or whittle
away the crust, then begin at one end and
pull and tear the loaf in two lengthwise, then
separate the halves into quarters, and then
into eighths. If the loaf is large, these pieces
can be divided again. Cover a large pan or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
biscuit sheet with paper, lay the bread upon
it, and put in a moderate oven for half an
hour or until it is dry and a golden brown.
It must be crisp to the center.</p>

<p>This will keep some weeks in a tin box, but
should be freshened in the oven before using.</p>


<h3><i>Deviled Toast</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cut</span> any dark bread into thin slices and
toast a golden brown. Mix well together one
tablespoonful of butter, one quarter of a teaspoonful
of mustard, a little cayenne and a
little onion juice, and spread on the toast.
Sprinkle over it a little grated cheese, and set
it in the oven till it is hot and serve at once.</p>


<h3><i>Hominy Crisps</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> one cup of hominy that has been cooked
and mashed through a sieve, add a little salt
and whole wheat flour to make a very stiff
dough. Knead well and roll it as thin as
possible. Cut in squares, puncture it with a
fork, and bake in a hot oven.</p>

<p>Cooked oatmeal may be used in the same
way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>Girdle Cakes</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Rub</span> thoroughly together two cups of flour,
one tablespoonful of sugar, half a teaspoonful
of salt, two tablespoonfuls of shortening, two
teaspoonfuls of baking powder, two tablespoonfuls
of currants or seedless raisins. Beat
one egg and add to it half a cup of milk. Stir
into the dry mixture till it makes a soft dough.
Turn on to a floured board and knead for a
minute, then roll out half an inch thick. Cut
out the size of a breakfast plate and cook
on a moderately hot griddle that has been
lightly greased. When brown turn and cook
on the other side. When done cut each cake
into quarters and turn up so as to brown the
cut edges. Split and butter and serve hot.</p>

<p>This can be cut in rounds with a biscuit
cutter and cooked the same way.</p>


<h3><i>A Paste to put on Buns when half baked</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mix</span> two teaspoonfuls of cornstarch with
one quarter of a cup of cold water. Pour over
it three quarters of a cup of boiling water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
and cook a few minutes. Brush this over the
half-baked buns, biscuits, or raisin bread, and
sprinkle with sugar. Put back and finish
baking.</p>

cup of shortening together in a saucepan on
the stove to melt. While this is heating beat
one egg and add it to one half cup of sour
milk. Sift together one teaspoonful of ginger,
a little clove, one half teaspoonful of salt, and
one teaspoonful of soda. Add these to the
hot molasses, and as it foams up pour it into

of whole wheat flour and beat till smooth.
Bake in a shallow pan in a moderate oven.</p>


<h3><i>Rye Gingerbread</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mix</span> together four tablespoonfuls of softened

molasses and beat into the first mixture. Add
one teaspoonful of ginger, one half teaspoonful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>

cup of molasses, one well-beaten egg, one cup

of cinnamon, one half tablespoonful
of cloves, and one tablespoonful of soda.
Mix thoroughly and add one and one half
cups of rye meal and three cups of rye flour.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
